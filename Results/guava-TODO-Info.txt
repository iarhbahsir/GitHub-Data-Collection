Content:   // TODO(user): Change API to make it impossible to use a Guard with the "wrong" monitor,
//    by making the monitor implicit, and to eliminate other sources of IMSE.
//    Imagine:
//    guard.lock();
//    try { /* monitor locked and guard satisfied here */ }
//    finally { guard.unlock(); }
// Here are Justin's design notes about this:
//
// This idea has come up from time to time, and I think one of my
// earlier versions of Monitor even did something like this. I ended
// up strongly favoring the current interface.
//
// I probably can't remember all the reasons (it's possible you
// could find them in the code review archives), but here are a few:
//
// 1. What about leaving/unlocking? Are you going to do
//    guard.enter() paired with monitor.leave()? That might get
//    confusing. It's nice for the finally block to look as close as
//    possible to the thing right before the try. You could have
//    guard.leave(), but that's a little odd as well because the
//    guard doesn't have anything to do with leaving. You can't
//    really enforce that the guard you're leaving is the same one
//    you entered with, and it doesn't actually matter.
//
// 2. Since you can enter the monitor without a guard at all, some
//    places you'll have monitor.enter()/monitor.leave() and other
//    places you'll have guard.enter()/guard.leave() even though
//    it's the same lock being acquired underneath. Always using
//    monitor.enterXXX()/monitor.leave() will make it really clear
//    which lock is held at any point in the code.
//
// 3. I think "enterWhen(notEmpty)" reads better than "notEmpty.enter()".
